## About

If you've found your way to this page, you're probably trying to get to know more about me.

Hi, my name is Akshay Gupta. I am a rising junior at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. I am a tech enthusiast; broadly interested in software systems, programming languages and cloud systems. I am fairly proficient in coding with c and c++. I install linux on laptops(that is not an expression). I like to characterize myself as a refulgent person . I love conversations about technology, politics and philosophy(_also a student of "Indian Philosophy"_).

In another world, I was a (self-proclaimed) brilliant science student when I appeared for the Joint Entrance Examination (_supposedly the toughest in the world_) where I managed to sneak by with a rank of 343 (among almost a million candidates, so maybe that was impressive).
